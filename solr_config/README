These files should go in solr's "conf" folder. If the bundle install is executed with the "path" flag (as it should), eg: "bundle install --path=vendor/gems", these files should be copied (and replaced) to the folder "my_project_path/vendor/gems/ruby/1.9.1/gems/sunspot_solr-1.3.3/solr/solr/conf/" (possibly varying in the ruby and sunspot_solr versions).
